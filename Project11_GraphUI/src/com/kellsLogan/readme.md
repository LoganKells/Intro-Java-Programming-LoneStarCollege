# Readme
The included java classes will create a sample graph using an ArrayList<Vertex>. 
The program will then display a graphical user interface of the vertices and 
the edges between the vertices as the (0,0) coordinate.

Use the "TestGraphUI" class main() method to test. 
View an example in "Example GraphUI.png".
