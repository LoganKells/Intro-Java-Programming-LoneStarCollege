### Instructions
For this assignment, you are to develop a program that creates a binary search tree.  
You are to then read the text file into the binary tree.  
Finally, you are supposed to output the in-order, pre-order, 
and post-order traversals of the binary tree. 

Be sure to put a header before each output i.e. Pre-order Traversal then the list of states.

Your program will be incorrect if you do not program the binary tree and instead use tree collection.
This means that you need to make the tree then output the results.

Use the package name com.firstNameLastName.treeStates.

Hints:

* You may want to create a Node class to define a tree node
* You may want to create a utility class to define how to print tree nodes
* You may want to create a BinaryTree class that has a node member
