* Created by: Logan Kells

### Instructions
Create a class called MyNumber with an integer private attribute.
* Create a constructor that defines an integer parameter to set the private integer attribute.
* Create a setter that validates the attribute does not accept a value lower than 2 or the method will throw a IllegalArgumetException.
* Create a getter to return the private integer attribute value.
* Define a public method that is called isPrime() that returns a boolean and implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes method.
* Define a public method that is called numberOfPrimes() that returns the number of prime numbers between 2 and the private attribute value.

Demonstrate this object in a main method that allows the user to interact with all the public methods of your class.
