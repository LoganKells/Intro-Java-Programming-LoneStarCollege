### Instructions
For this assignment, you are to develop a program that creates an AVL search tree.  

You are to then read the text file into the AVL tree.  

Finally, you are supposed to output the in-order, pre-order, 
and post-order traversals of the AVL tree. 

Be sure to put a header before each output i.e. Pre-order Traversal then the list of states.

Use the package name com.firstNameLastName.treeStates.

Hints:

* You may want to create a Node class to define a tree node
* You may want to create a utility class to define how to print tree nodes
* You may want to create a AVLTree class that has a node member
