# Overview
This java package will utilize the stream() methods (from Java collections) to do the following using the data in the newStates.txt file:
* print out all the states
* print all the states that have the letter 'r' (any case) in it.
* print any state that has multiple words in the state name (e.g. New York)

The AVL tree will be printed to the console using the following traversal (cursor walk) methods:
* In-order
* Post-order
* Pre-order

Use the TestAVLTree class to test. This will search in the local "./resources" path for the file you enter in the console after prompted. 

## Included Files
The following files are included in this package.
* ./src/package/TestCollectionStream.java
* ./src/package/LoadData.java
* ./src/package/Instructions.md
* ./src/package/readme.md
* ./resources/newStates.txt

## .txt file format
* Please add any .txt files to a resource folder in a local "./resources" path.
* Please include ".txt" in the filename when prompted in the console.
* Separate data by new lines in the .txt file.

## Run a sample
1.) Please utilize the "TestCollectionStream" class to run the collection stream examples.

2.) Enter the filename when prompted. One example .txt is provided "newStates.txt" in ./resources.

3.) Review the results in the console.
